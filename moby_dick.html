            The <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing paltform was designed mainly for ebooks like the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial </em>book</a> and <a href="http://learnenough.com/htmls"><em>Learn Enough to be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melvilled (sometimes written as <em>Moby-Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionatel irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

                <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
